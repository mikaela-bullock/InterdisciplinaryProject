  <!-- ABOUT / WHY I CARE -->
  <section id="about">
    <h2>About & Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Mikaela Bullock. I am a student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison majoring in
      Economics (Math Emphasis) and Computer Science.
    </p>
    <p>
      I care about answering this question because it reflects my own position as a student who is involved in both worlds.
      As a computer science and economics major who spends a lot of time reading and writing, I constantly feel the gap between
      how my STEM classes and humanities-oriented work define “expertise.” In programming courses, clarity often means efficiency
      and correctness, while in humanities clarity is about nuance and the ability to account for multiple perspectives.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project is a way for me to express these tensions rather than just living with them. By building my own website,
      I can use my technical skills in HTML and CSS while drawing on the interpretive and rhetorical skills I have practiced in this course.
      Digital design is inherently interdisciplinary, and I want this project’s form to reflect that message.

  <!-- COURSE QUESTION -->
  <section id="question">
    <h2>Course Question</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>What is the relationship between STEM and Humanities thinking and expertise?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      I explore this question by examining how each discipline defines clarity, what counts as strong communication,
      and how meaning is produced not just through information, but through presentation, interpretation, and context.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ARGUMENT -->
  <section id="argument">
    <h2>My Argument</h2>
    <p>
      My argument is that STEM and Humanities expertise are not opposites but interdependent.
      Technical knowledge becomes meaningful when it can be communicated, interpreted, and ethically framed.
      Likewise, humanistic analysis gains power when it engages with technical systems, data, and the tools that shape modern life.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my academic experience, STEM disciplines often prioritize efficiency and correctness,
      while humanities disciplines emphasize ambiguity, perspective, and audience.
      This project argues that true expertise requires both precision and interpretive depth.

  <!-- ARTIFACTS -->
  <section id="artifacts">
    <h2>Artifacts (from different disciplines)</h2>

    <h3>Artifact 1: This Website (HTML/CSS)</h3>
    <p>
      My first artifact is the website itself, which I coded using HTML and CSS.
      The site functions as both a project and an argument: neither STEM nor the humanities can stand alone.
      Without humanities-based skills like organization, rhetorical awareness, and clarity of expression, I would not be able
      to communicate my technical work in a meaningful way. It would be unfair of me to assume that everyone has a strong
	  technical background, so it is important for me to be skilled at articulating myself to those who may not understand tech jargon.
    </p>

    <h3>Artifact 2: Art of Science Exhibition </h3>
    <p>
      My second artifact is the <em>Art of Science</em> exhibition discussed in class.
        It exemplifies the relationship between scientific inquiry and artistic interpretation by transforming
        data, experimentation, and observation into visual forms that invite reflection and engagement.
		This image strengthens my argument by demonstrating that scientific discovery depends on interpretive 
		and communicative choices traditionally associated with the humanities. While the image documents a 
		biological breakthrough, its meaning emerges through visual design decisions such as color enhancement, framing, 
		and emphasis. These choices guide the viewer’s understanding and transform technical data into accessible knowledge.
		In this way, the image mirrors the structure of my own project: both rely on technical expertise to produce content, 
		but require rhetorical and visual interpretation to make that content meaningful.

    <h2>Sources</h2>
    <p>
      The following sources provide theoretical, historical, and educational perspectives that deepen
      my understanding of the relationship between STEM and humanities expertise. Each source helps explain
      why interdisciplinary thinking is not supplemental, but essential to meaningful communication.

          <strong> Ken Arnold: “A very public affair: art meets science.”</strong><br>
          <a href="https://journals-sagepub-com.ezproxy.library.wisc.edu/doi/pdf/10.1080/03080188.2017.1381224"

            https://journals-sagepub-com.ezproxy.library.wisc.edu/doi/pdf/10.1080/03080188.2017.1381224
          </a>
        </p>
       <p>
         Ken Arnold’s analysis of art–science collaborations helps clarify why visual forms like the
         <em>Art of Science</em> exhibition are central to how scientific knowledge becomes meaningful.
  		 Arnold argues that interdisciplinary work is most powerful when it exists in public-facing
  		 forms, noting that “interdisciplinary collisions are most evocatively and meaningfully
 		 encountered by looking at things in public galleries.” This claim is important to my argument
  		because it frames exhibitions and visual artifacts as active sites of knowledge production
  		rather than mere illustrations of scientific facts that exist in isolation. This connects well with
	    <em>The Art of Science Exhibition</em> because it is exactly the type of process Arnold refers to:
  		 although it documents a biological breakthrough, its significance emerges through
  		visual emphasis, color, and framing that guide interpretation. Arnold’s work reinforces this idea
  		that STEM expertise depends on humanities-based practices such as visual rhetoric and audience
  		awareness to transform technical discoveries into shared, public knowledge.

          <strong>Art Institute of Chicago. “The Enduring Relationship of Science and Art”</strong><br>
          <a href="https://archive.artic.edu/sciarttech/2a1.html"
             target="_blank" rel="noopener">

        </p>
        <p>
  		The Art Institute of Chicago’s discussion of art and scientific investigation provides a historical
  		foundation for my argument that STEM and humanities thinking have never been separate domains.
  		The text states that “science and art naturally overlap” and emphasizes that both disciplines are
  		“means of investigation” in which ideas and hypotheses are tested through the collaboration of
  		mind and hand. This claim is significant because it challenges the modern assumption that technical
  		and expressive expertise belong to different intellectual spheres. By tracing this overlap from
  		ancient Greek concepts of <em>techne</em> through figures like Leonardo da Vinci, Monet, and Picasso,
  		the source demonstrates that scientific precision and artistic interpretation have long worked
  		together to produce knowledge. This historical perspective strengthens my argument by showing that
  		interdisciplinary thinking is not a contemporary trend but a foundational mode of inquiry that
  		continues to shape how complex ideas are understood and communicated today.

        <p>
  The interdisciplinary biology education study <em>“The Visual Art of Biology”</em> further supports my
  argument that scientific understanding deepens when technical knowledge is paired with creative and
  expressive practices. The authors emphasize that “science helps create citizens who question the why
  and how of things,” but argue that this goal is best achieved through active, interdisciplinary learning
  rather than rote memorization. This claim is significant because it reframes science education as a
  process of inquiry and interpretation, not just information acquisition. By showing that students
  better comprehend biological concepts when they translate them into artistic forms, the study
  demonstrates how humanities-based skills such as visual communication, reflection, and meaning-making
  enhance scientific expertise. This directly parallels my own project: while I rely on technical coding
  skills to construct the website, it is the interpretive and rhetorical choices—developed through
  humanities coursework—that allow my argument about STEM and humanities to become accessible and
  compelling.
