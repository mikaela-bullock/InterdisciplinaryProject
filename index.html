    <!-- ABOUT ME FIRST -->
    <section id="about">
        <h2>About the Creator</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Mikaela Bullock, and I am a student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison
            majoring in Economics (Math Emphasis) and Computer Science.
        </p>
	        <p>
            I care deeply about the question this project asks because I live at the intersection
            of technical and humanistic thinking. As someone trained in programming, data analysis,
            and mathematical modeling, I also spend significant time writing, teaching, and
            communicating complex ideas to others.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project emerges from my belief that technical expertise alone is not enough.
            Meaningful work in STEM requires interpretation, narrative, and ethical reflection—
            skills traditionally associated with the humanities. I am interested in how these
            modes of thinking inform and strengthen one another rather than existing in opposition.

    <section id="overview">
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This website serves as both my project and my argument: technical skills and humanistic
            expression are deeply interconnected. Through a digital medium built with HTML and CSS,
            I demonstrate how coding and communication work together to convey meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
            By using the structure of a website as my medium, I highlight how even technical tools
            rely on rhetorical choices—organization, emphasis, and visual design—to guide
            interpretation.

        <h2>Selected Artifact</h2>
        <p>
            My project draws on the
            <a href="https://artofsci.princeton.edu/2025-art-of-science-exhibition/" target="_blank">
                Art of Science exhibition
            </a>
            as an example of how visual media bridges scientific inquiry and artistic interpretation.
            The exhibition illustrates how scientific data, experimentation, and observation can
            be transformed into visual forms that invite reflection and emotional engagement.

        <h2>Argument & Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            This project argues that technical knowledge becomes meaningful only when paired with
            the ability to articulate, interpret, and communicate ideas. Writing, analysis, and
            critical thinking—skills rooted in the humanities—shape how information is presented
            and understood, even in digital and computational environments.
        </p>
        <p>
            In creating this website, I rely on coding as the technical foundation, while my
            humanities background guides the narrative structure, tone, and purpose. The final
            product reflects my belief that interdisciplinary thinking is essential to both
            effective communication and responsible technological work.
