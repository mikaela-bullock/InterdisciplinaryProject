        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This website serves as both my project and my argument: technical skills and humanistic expression
            are deeply interconnected. Through a digital medium built with HTML and CSS, I demonstrate how
            coding and communication work together to convey meaning.

        <h2>Selected Artifact</h2>
        <p>
            My project draws on the *Art of Science* exhibition, using it as an example of how visual media
            bridges scientific inquiry and artistic interpretation. The exhibition illustrates how scientific
            data and creative presentation can merge to deepen understanding.

        <h2>Argument & Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            This project argues that technical knowledge is only meaningful when paired with the ability to
            articulate, interpret, and communicate ideas. Writing, analysis, and critical thinking—skills rooted
            in the humanities—shape how we present and understand information, even in digital environments.
        </p>
        <p>
            In creating this website, I use coding as the technical foundation, while relying on my humanities
            background to structure the narrative, clarify meaning, and make deliberate rhetorical choices.
