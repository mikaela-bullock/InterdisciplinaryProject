  <!-- ABOUT / WHY I CARE -->
  <section id="about">
    <h2>About & Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Mikaela Bullock. I am a student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison majoring in
      Economics (Math Emphasis) and Computer Science.
    </p>
    <p>
      I care about answering this question because it reflects my own position as a student who is involved in both worlds.
      As a computer science and economics major who spends a lot of time reading and writing, I constantly feel the gap between
      how my STEM classes and humanities-oriented work define “expertise.” In programming courses, clarity often means efficiency
      and correctness, while in humanities clarity is about nuance and the ability to account for multiple perspectives.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project is a way for me to express these tensions rather than just living with them. By building my own website,
      I can use my technical skills in HTML and CSS while drawing on the interpretive and rhetorical skills I have practiced in this course.
      Digital design is inherently interdisciplinary, and I want this project’s form to reflect that message.
    </p>

  <!-- COURSE QUESTION -->
  <section id="question">
    <h2>Course Question</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>What is the relationship between STEM and Humanities thinking and expertise?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      I explore this question by examining how each discipline defines clarity, what counts as strong communication,
      and how meaning is produced not just through information, but through presentation, interpretation, and context.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ARGUMENT -->
  <section id="argument">
    <h2>My Argument</h2>
    <p>
      My argument is that STEM and Humanities expertise are not opposites but interdependent.
      Technical knowledge becomes meaningful when it can be communicated, interpreted, and ethically framed.
      Likewise, humanistic analysis gains power when it engages with technical systems, data, and the tools that shape modern life.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my academic experience, STEM disciplines often prioritize efficiency and correctness,
      while humanities disciplines emphasize ambiguity, perspective, and audience.
      This project argues that true expertise requires both precision and interpretive depth.

  <!-- ARTIFACTS -->
  <section id="artifacts">
    <h2>Artifacts (from different disciplines)</h2>

    <h3>Artifact 1: This Website (HTML/CSS)</h3>
    <p>
      My first artifact is the website itself, which I coded using HTML and CSS.
      The site functions as both a project and an argument: neither STEM nor the humanities can stand alone.
      Without humanities-based skills—organization, rhetorical awareness, and clarity of expression, I would not be able
      to communicate my technical work in a meaningful way. It would be unfair of me to assume that everyone has a strong
	  technical background, so it is important for me to be skilled at articulating myself to those who may not understand tech jargon.
    </p>

    <h3>Artifact 2: Art of Science Exhibition </h3>
    <p>
      My second artifact is the <em>Art of Science</em> exhibition discussed in class.
        It exemplifies the relationship between scientific inquiry and artistic interpretation by transforming
        data, experimentation, and observation into visual forms that invite reflection and engagement.
		This image strengthens my argument by demonstrating that scientific discovery depends on interpretive 
		and communicative choices traditionally associated with the humanities. While the image documents a 
		biological breakthrough, its meaning emerges through visual design decisions such as color enhancement, framing, 
		and emphasis. These choices guide the viewer’s understanding and transform technical data into accessible knowledge.
		In this way, the image mirrors the structure of my own project: both rely on technical expertise to produce content, 
		but require rhetorical and visual interpretation to make that content meaningful.

    <h2>Sources</h2>
    <p>
      The following sources provide theoretical, historical, and educational perspectives that deepen
      my understanding of the relationship between STEM and humanities expertise. Each source helps explain
      why interdisciplinary thinking is not supplemental, but essential to meaningful communication.

          <strong> Ken Arnold: “A very public affair: art meets science.”</strong><br>
          <a href="https://journals-sagepub-com.ezproxy.library.wisc.edu/doi/pdf/10.1080/03080188.2017.1381224"

          </a>
        </p>
        <p>
  		   Ken Arnold’s discussion of art–science collaborations helps explain why visual forms like the
  		   <em>Art of Science</em> exhibition are not secondary to scientific work, but central to how knowledge
  			is produced and shared. Arnold argues that museums and exhibitions function as spaces where scientific
  			ideas become public, interpretable, and meaningful through curatorial and aesthetic choices, rather than
 		    remaining confined to specialized disciplines. This supports my argument that STEM expertise depends on
 		    humanities-based practices such as narrative framing, visual design, and audience awareness. The exhibition
 		   image I analyze demonstrates this relationship clearly: although it represents a scientific breakthrough,
  			its significance emerges through color, composition, and contextual explanation. Arnold’s work reinforces
 			 my claim that interdisciplinary thinking is not an add-on to science, but a necessary condition for making
  			scientific knowledge legible and impactful beyond expert communities.

          This historical overview demonstrates that the relationship between art and science has existed for centuries,
          from monumental architecture to figures such as Leonardo da Vinci. This source matters because it challenges
          the modern assumption that STEM and humanities are naturally separate domains. By situating interdisciplinary
          practice within a long historical tradition, the article supports my claim that technical and expressive expertise
          have always been intertwined rather than opposed.

          This study provides an educational perspective on interdisciplinary learning by examining how students engage
          more deeply with scientific content when they also create artwork. The findings are significant for my project
          because they empirically support the idea that creative interpretation enhances comprehension rather than diluting
          technical rigor. This mirrors my own project structure: I use technical coding skills to build the site, but rely on
          humanities-based analytical and expressive skills to make my ideas meaningful and accessible.
